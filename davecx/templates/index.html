	<h3>Welcome</h3>
	<p>Hi, I'm David! A 20 years old dude currently living in Munich, Germany. </p>
	<p>As you  might guess from this website, I'm a software engineer. I am currently working for the company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chip.de/cxo/">CHIP Xonio Online GmbH</a> in munich. If you're from germany, you might know their site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chip.de/">chip.de</a>.</p>
	<p>Although my speciality is web development, doesn't meen I can't do anything else ;)</p>
	<p>I enjoy playing around with technologies and try new things. This is more or less the reason for this site. See it as my private playground to test things out :)</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Please keep in mind that this site is in an very early state. It will hopefully become bigger over time!</p>
	<h3>Contact me</h3>
	<p>Do you have anything to tell me? Feel free to contact me anytime.</p>
	<p>In general, I prefer email - write me at <a href="mailto:dave@dave.cx">dave@dave.cx</a>. You can find me in several social networks though.</p>
	<p>Me on the interwebs: 
		{% for profile in profiles %}
			<a class="socialitem" href="{{ profile.url }}" target="_blank">
				<img alt="{{ profile.name }}" class="tooltip socialicon" src="{{ profile.icon.url }}" alt="">
			</a>
		{% endfor %}
