        "title": "Mt. Fuji: To the top!", 
        "visibility": 1, 
        "content": "Going to japan and not climbing fuji would be somewhat... wrong, so of course I had to do it. Fuji is 3776m high, the climbing season usually starts in july and ends in early september. I think you can also climb it off season but during the season it's easier or something. Maybe because it's not that cold on the top? I don't know.\r\n\r\nThere are different ways to climb fuji. From the tokyo site you usually go either from the bottom (takes 12h to the top) or the middle (6h). 6h climbing is enough for me. We picked the way from the middle. To be specific, Fujisan 5th station (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u4e94\u5408\u76ee).\r\n\r\nYou can go there by bus only during the season, we reserved our tickets on highwaybus (https://highwaybus.com/rs-web01-prd-rel/gp/index). The whole trip was around 5.000\u5186. \r\n\r\nMostly people climb fuji to see the sunset or the sunrise on the summit. We picked the sunrise for us and started going there at 7 pm from Shinjuku. At 10:30 we arrived at 5th station and started climbing through the night. \r\n\r\n![Sign at Fuji trail start](http://i.imgur.com/kCGDF.jpg?1)\r\n\r\nThe way is more or less splitted into different \"parts\". At first you are just following a way. More like hiking. After a while the way turns into serpentines. Zig-zag. This lasts for some hours and is still kinda easy to go.\r\n\r\nDuring your way to the top you will arrive at some \"stations\" and smaller houses. There are toilets for 200\u5186 and some snacks sold by people living there. Usually hikers use these places for breaks. \r\n\r\nAfter a few hours of serpentines the way turns very very rocky. This is were hiking is over. You are actually \"climbing\" stones straight up to the top. As the way gets more and more narrow you will find yourself in a point where you actually stand in a queue behind some other people before you can step on the next rock! (Maybe only because we went there on weekend... I don't know...)\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets annoying. Your speed depends completely on the people infront of you! If just 1 person takes a break to take a picture or something, everyone behind him (including you, even if your 10 people after) has to wait until he finished. A hint: Use stations to go infront of people groups as they will very likely be in your way!\r\n\r\nThis escalates when you nearly reach the top and the sun is slowly coming out. As everyone there wants to take a picture of the sunrise, no one will continue walking. We usually had to wait 10 seconds or more to take the next step to the top.\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem is that during the whole trip, you sweat a lot! When moving you don't really feel cold, but when standing (even if it's just for 10 seconds) you can really feel the 5\u00b0C at the summit. \r\n\r\nAfter 7h straight climbing we did it! We stood on the top of mount fuji and enjoyed the morning sun. \r\n\r\n![Morning sun on top of Fuji mountain](http://i.imgur.com/vfPeX.jpg?1)\r\n\r\nThe way down was around 3-4 hours but because of the slippy way much harder than ascending (at least for me). But now you can finally enjoy the beautiful view and the warm sunlight, even on cold fuji! \r\n\r\n![Way down #1](http://i.imgur.com/vIzjv.jpg?1)\r\n\r\n![Way down #2](http://i.imgur.com/mdZRU.jpg?1)\r\n\r\nThank you fuji for this awesome day! \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\r\n\r\n\"The one who doesn't climb fuji is a fool. The one who does it twice is a even bigger fool.\"",

        "content": "My last job ran out past friday, but instead of searching a new one, I felt more like investing my time completely into my company. At least for some weeks. I booked a ticket to Southeast Asia (Bangkok, Thailand) where I am able to survive far longer than I could in Germany using the rest-money on my bank account.\r\n\r\nDo I regret it? Not yet. I am doing exactly what I want to do: Working on what I really love and choosing the location I feel most comfortable with right now - some sort backpacking with a Company I guess.  Of course there is risk involved. I am completely depending on my company and the daily work I do. If I'm too lazy, I might end up with no money at the end of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now, everything's still very theoretic. Let's see what the future, especially the next month, brings!\r\n\r\n*the image is MBK in Bangkok btw*",

        "visibility": 3, 
        "content": "Followers of my blog might now that I really like japan. During the last 2 years, I visited Tokyo 2 times; for 1 and for 4 month. \r\n\r\nDuring my 4 month trip, I started getting attached to Tokyo and looked around at the job market over there. After having a few interviews, I did the decision and said to myself, \"I want to live here.\". I took myself some time to think everything through, spoke with my family and decided what to do. Shortly after I found a company I really like, the visa application process began. This was in October 2012, and where my timeline begins:\r\n\r\n- **November 2012**: I've been asked to submit additional documents and informations about my education. (I did a vocational education as software engineer in Germany). \r\n\r\n- **December 2012**: The visa process has entered it's final phase and should be over in a bit.\r\n\r\n- **January 2013**: My visa application got rejected. The reason: Undereducated. I don't have a university, nor 10 years of working experience or a IT certificate that is accepted in Japan. I have however a 3 years IT vocational education which should be worth something, right? \r\n\r\n- **February 2013**: I decided to appeal at the immigration office. I gathered some information about the german education system, information about the content of my VET, information and proofs about projects I've been involved in and stuff I did in my past. \r\n\r\nDuring that time, I resigned from my job in Germany (3 month resignation period). \r\n\r\nThe appeal reached the immigration office and the answer was very clear: Even though they agree that I have the necessary/sufficient skills for the job, I am not eligible. It is **impossible** for me to reapply or appeal again. \r\n\r\n- **March 2013**: Giving up? Not yet! Besides Software Engineering, I also have experience and skills in User Experience Design (UXD), Visual Experience Design (VXD) and general Web Design. \r\n\r\nRequirements for this visa were 3 years of working experience, which I have. I acquired written statements from my previous companies confirming my experience, alongside some other required documents. \r\n\r\n- **April 2013**: I finished gathering all needed informations and the next application process began. \r\n\r\n- **Mai 2013**: The application is taking longer than expected, a answer is expected in the first part of June. \r\n\r\nAt this time, my working contract in Germany ended. I started my own business and left Germany to a country near Japan. \r\n\r\n- **June 2013**: The application process is taking a little longer, as there were issues with my application. It can take up to 3 more months for a conclusion. \r\n\r\nLuckily it didn't take that long. End of June, I got my next answer: The application got rejected once again. The reasons were the same as before: No 10 years of working experience, no university degree, no certification. The visa I applied on apparently wasn't enough for a design job in the internet business. \r\n\r\nGiving up?? Nah!\r\n\r\n- **July 2013**: I decided to visit Japan once again for a month. This time on a tourist visa to attend some festivals and fireworks happening during july / august. \r\n\r\nOn the airport, I got dragged out at the immigration counter since something flagged me up in their system. I had to follow to a interview room I already knew from the year before, but that's a different story. I got asked a lot of questions, where I am coming from and why I don't have a onward ticket. \r\n\r\nAfter explaining everything, a immigration officer came back with my passport and the tourist visa stamp inside. He told me in a very sharp voice that I am not allowed to work in Japan on this visa. I assume they think I will work illegally? \r\n\r\nAnyway, after getting my baggage and going to the \"nothing to declare\" counter, they opened my bag (nothing unusual) and another airport guy joined us. I got asked more questions: Why did I come to Japan? Do I like Japan? What am I going to do during this month? \r\n\r\nEveryone was really friendly and helpful. After explaining everything once again, I was allowed to pass the gates into Japan! I even mentioned my working visa attempts and made the guy smile. (Pretty sure he knew that already anyway)\r\n\r\n- **August 2013**: I am re-thinking my current options left. After visiting my ex-japanese school, just for saying hi, they told me that there is a language course I could attend. Including getting a student visa. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, I can't take any course I want because I don't have 12 years of highschool, which is a requirement here in Japan. Only special courses that are \"approved by the ministry of justice\" are working. Otherwise my visa would very likely get rejected.\r\n\r\n- **September**: I handed in my application details for the language course. Visa application will take, as always, around 1 month. This is my **3rd attempt** of getting a japanese visa. \r\n\r\n- **October 2013**: ??? ",

        "content": "It's been a while since my addon ProxMate is out in the wild wild world. Over the months I grabbed a bunch of (positive and negative) experiences when it comes to releasing. \r\n\r\nMy major problem was the slow reviewing process on mozillas side when pushing a update. Sometimes this happens within 1 day, sometimes after 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nBut do you really need to push an update when changing a service? When just changing a proxy rule? No you don't.\r\n\r\n### The concept\r\n\r\nSince version 2.1, ProxMate became a central thing. Or in other words a client-server application. The addon core has been reduced to only include a logic for enabling / disabling modules and parsing a config script (ignore the banner by now).\r\n\r\n![Admin interface #1](http://i.imgur.com/h79R5.png)\r\n\r\nWhen launching the addon, ProxMate calls a mothership (a.k.a. my server), pulls a config file, parses it and saves the settings in local storage. This process should happen every 30 minutes. If the server is unavailable (caused by whatever reason), the addon will simply use the last saved config. \r\n\r\nThis makes reacting and pushing \"shadow updates\" (a.k.a. not code updates) really fast. Adding a service happens in an instant and within 30 minutes every user using v2.1+ will run the new code.\r\n\r\n### Applying the same thing to proxy nodes\r\n\r\nIf you have to maintain multiple proxy servers, you don't have the time to configure a whitelist, userlist, configs or whatever on every single of them. Using the concept above, I automated the process. \r\n\r\nA cron is installed, pulling a whitelist, userlist, config and whatsoever all x minutes. Entries are configured over a simple admin interface\r\n\r\n![Admin interface #2](http://i.imgur.com/r0yjW.png)\r\n\r\n### Single point of failure?\r\n\r\nWell, yes. But even if the webserver dies, caches will still hold a usable config. And if that dies, a static config is being used. And even if that fails, ProxMate will simply use the last available config and continue working. Completely without a mothership server.\r\n\r\nUsing a bunch of fallbacks and caches, a total fallout is very unlikely.",
