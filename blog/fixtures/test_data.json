I am doing exactly what I want to do: Working on what I really love and choosing the location I feel most comfortable with right now - some sort backpacking with a Company I guess.  Of course there is risk involved. I am completely depending on my company and the daily work I do. If I\u2019m too lazy, I might end up with no money at the end of the month.\r\n\r\nRight now, everything\u2019s still very theoretic.

        "title": "Mt. Fuji: To the top!",
        "content": "Going to japan and not climbing fuji would be somewhat\u2026 wrong, so of course I had to do it. Fuji is 3776m high, the climbing season usually starts in july and ends in early september. I think you can also climb it off season but during the season it\u2019s easier or something. Maybe because it\u2019s not that cold on the top? I don\u2019t know.\r\nThere are different ways to climb fuji. From the tokyo site you usually go either from the bottom (takes 12h to the top) or the middle (6h). 6h climbing is enough for me. We picked the way from the middle. To be specific, Fujisan 5th station (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u4e94\u5408\u76ee).\r\n\r\nYou can go there by bus only during the season, we reserved our tickets on highwaybus (https://highwaybus.com/rs-web01-prd-rel/gp/index). The whole trip was around 5.000\u5186. \r\nMostly people climb fuji to see the sunset or the sunrise on the summit. We picked the sunrise for us and started going there at 7 pm from Shinjuku. At 10:30 we arrived at 5th station and started climbing through the night. \r\n\r\nThe way is more or less splitted into different \u201cparts\u201d. At first you are just following a way. More like hiking. After a while the way turns into serpentines. Zig-zag. This lasts for some hours and is still kinda easy to go.\r\nDuring your way to the top you will arrive at some \u201cstations\u201d and smaller houses. There are toilets for 200\u5186 and some snacks sold by people living there. Usually hikers use these places for breaks. \r\nAfter a few hours of serpentines the way turns very very rocky. This is were hiking is over. You are actually \u201cclimbing\u201d stones straight up to the top. As the way gets more and more narrow you will find yourself in a point where you actually stand in a queue behind some other people before you can step on the next rock! (Maybe only because we went there on weekend\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026)\r\nThis is where it gets annoying. Your speed depends completely on the people infront of you! If just 1 person takes a break to take a picture or something, everyone behind him (including you, even if your 10 people after) has to wait until he finished. A hint: Use stations to go infront of people groups as they will very likely be in your way!\r\nThis escalates when you nearly reach the top and the sun is slowly coming out. As everyone there wants to take a picture of the sunrise, no one will continue walking. We usually had to wait 10 seconds or more to take the next step to the top.\r\nThe bigger problem is that during the whole trip, you sweat a lot! When moving you don\u2019t really feel cold, but when standing (even if it\u2019s just for 10 seconds) you can really feel the 5\u00b0C at the summit. \r\nAfter 7h straight climbing we did it! We stood on the top of mount fuji and enjoyed the morning sun. \r\n\r\nThank you fuji for this awesome day! \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\r\n\"The one who doesn\u2019t climb fuji is a fool.

        "content": "Going to japan and not climbing fuji would be somewhat\u2026 wrong, so of course I had to do it. Fuji is 3776m high, the climbing season usually starts in july and ends in early september. I think you can also climb it off season but during the season it\u2019s easier or something. Maybe because it\u2019s not that cold on the top? I don\u2019t know.\r\nThere are different ways to climb fuji. From the tokyo site you usually go either from the bottom (takes 12h to the top) or the middle (6h). 6h climbing is enough for me. We picked the way from the middle. To be specific, Fujisan 5th station (\u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71\u4e94\u5408\u76ee).\r\n\r\nYou can go there by bus only during the season, we reserved our tickets on highwaybus (https://highwaybus.com/rs-web01-prd-rel/gp/index). The whole trip was around 5.000\u5186. \r\nMostly people climb fuji to see the sunset or the sunrise on the summit. We picked the sunrise for us and started going there at 7 pm from Shinjuku. At 10:30 we arrived at 5th station and started climbing through the night. \r\n\r\nThe way is more or less splitted into different \u201cparts\u201d. At first you are just following a way. More like hiking. After a while the way turns into serpentines. Zig-zag. This lasts for some hours and is still kinda easy to go.\r\nDuring your way to the top you will arrive at some \u201cstations\u201d and smaller houses. There are toilets for 200\u5186 and some snacks sold by people living there. Usually hikers use these places for breaks. \r\nAfter a few hours of serpentines the way turns very very rocky. This is were hiking is over. You are actually \u201cclimbing\u201d stones straight up to the top. As the way gets more and more narrow you will find yourself in a point where you actually stand in a queue behind some other people before you can step on the next rock! (Maybe only because we went there on weekend\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026)\r\nThis is where it gets annoying. Your speed depends completely on the people infront of you! If just 1 person takes a break to take a picture or something, everyone behind him (including you, even if your 10 people after) has to wait until he finished. A hint: Use stations to go infront of people groups as they will very likely be in your way!\r\nThis escalates when you nearly reach the top and the sun is slowly coming out. As everyone there wants to take a picture of the sunrise, no one will continue walking. We usually had to wait 10 seconds or more to take the next step to the top.\r\nThe bigger problem is that during the whole trip, you sweat a lot! When moving you don\u2019t really feel cold, but when standing (even if it\u2019s just for 10 seconds) you can really feel the 5\u00b0C at the summit. \r\nAfter 7h straight climbing we did it! We stood on the top of mount fuji and enjoyed the morning sun. \r\n\r\nThank you fuji for this awesome day! \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\r\n\"The one who doesn\u2019t climb fuji is a fool. The one who does it twice is a even bigger fool.\"",
